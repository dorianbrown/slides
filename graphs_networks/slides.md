Why graphs are awesome (and sometimes useful)

---

Topics:

- PageRank, TextRank, and all the "rank" algorithms


## Graphical Models (big field of modelling techniques)

Directed graphical models (aka Bayesian Networks)
    - How do we learn the network topology?
    - How do we learn all the probabilities of the network

## Quick Introduction

## The graph ecosystem

All the different kinds of graphs

- Directed or not
- Weighted
- Random/Deterministic

Within each of these many interesting subcategories:
- DAG
- Chordal
- etc.
