# Personal Presentations

This repository contains all my personal presentations. These have been made with [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), so check out the repository if you're curious about the details.

## Installation

In order to get the slides running, you first need to have [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) installed. Once that's done, you can follow these steps to get a presentation running:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the repository in your terminal.
2. Execute `reveal-md [presentation-folder]/slides.md`
3. A browser window should be opened automatically, otherwise you can go to `localhost:1984`

As these are my personal presentations, I won't be accepting any any merge requests, but feel free to browse and use them (if you credit me :smiley:)
